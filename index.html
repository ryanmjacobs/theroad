            “He mistrusted all of that. He said the right dreams for a man in
            peril were dreams of peril and all else was the call of languor and
            death.
            </p>

            <p>
            He slept little and he slept poorly.
            </p>

            He dreamt of walking in a flowering wood where birds flew before
            them and the child and the sky was aching blue but he was learning
            how to wake himself from just such siren worlds.

            Lying there in the dark with the uncanny taste of peach from some
            phantom orchard fading in his mouth.

            He thought if he lived long enough the world at last would all be
            lost. Like the dying world the newly blind inhabit, all of it
            slowly fading from memory.”
